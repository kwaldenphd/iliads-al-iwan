13:59:23 From  Katherine (Katie) Walden | she/her  to  Everyone:
	Folks can take a few more minutes to finish their notes and/or read through colleagues' notes
14:06:06 From  Donna R  to  Everyone:
	sorry
14:06:11 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	never mind
14:06:30 From  Najla Jarkas  to  Everyone:
	No problem
14:06:36 From  Najla Jarkas  to  Everyone:
	We’re all working from home
14:15:10 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	We also need to know the time frame to see how can this be implemented
14:19:12 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	But if it is just listing Till that would be just a sort of a Research GUIde
14:19:31 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	You are absolutely right
14:21:09 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	what about harvesting metadata on the item level and submit everything to Wikidata? Crazy but would allow to pull in data/ point users to related material through a knowledge graph
14:21:58 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	I think Najla is trying to make your life hard Elie

14:36:58 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	I already posted this on slack: our daughters picked up some infections at the nursery late last week and I might need to pop out in about an hour to help my spouse put them to bed
14:43:57 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	sorry I have to attend to the kids for the next 30 mins
14:49:24 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	sure Najla I am talking about the members of the group who are taking care of the technical part
14:56:09 From  Till Grallert  to  Everyone:
	now that I think about it, would it be possible to record the ongoing conversation?
15:01:08 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	I think when the scope of the project is identified that will make things clear and easy to visualize the amount  of time and devotion is needed

	For those who might not be familiar with the digital humanities or library technology projects and resources, maybe another way to think about this prompt is other websites or platforms that are doing things you think are similar to what this project might do.
15:16:00 From  Samar Mikati  to  Everyone:
	I am sorry but I need to leave now
